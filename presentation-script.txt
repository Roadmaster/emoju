We all use lots of command-line tools, often to be ridiculed by GUI-oriented
users making fun of our terminals. This is particularly notable if you do
devops or system tasks, since these days even text editors have fancy GUIs
but CLI utils have been sadly neglected.

So I thought: What if we can bring these tools gloriously into the 21st
century?

And which better tool to modernize than the much-loved juju?

WIth that in mind, I present: emoju, an emoji-based version of juju where all
commands have been replaced with emoji. Here's how it works.

#How to run the presentation
$ cd emojiland or whatever
$ . complete2.sh
$ export PATH=$PWD:$PATH
$ cd
$ clear
# Now ready to run
$ export EMOJU_REAL=yes  # optional

# If it's a 10-minute presentation, maybe do this with real juju, if have access to the big server.
# If not, just show the translations
# To access sonar:
# mosh --ssh="ssh -p 22222" --port=22223:22230 192.222.154.199
# from there ssh ubuntu@juju-demo.local
# cd emoju


Let's run through a typical deployment workflow using emoju. For expediency
it won't run the actual juju equivalents, just show them so you can confirm
the equivalences.
