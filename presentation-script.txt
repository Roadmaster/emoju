We all use lots of command-line tools, often to be ridiculed by GUI-oriented
users making fun of our terminals. This is particularly notable if you do
devops or system tasks, since these days even text editors have fancy GUIs
but CLI utils have been sadly neglected.

So I thought: What if we can bring these tools gloriously into the 21st
century?

And which better tool to modernize than the much-loved juju?

WIth that in mind, I present: emoju, an emoji-based version of juju where all
commands have been replaced with emoji. Here's how it works.

#How to run the presentation
$ cd emojiland or whatever
$ . complete2.sh
$ export PATH=$PWD:$PATH
$ cd
$ clear
# Now ready to run
$ export EMOJU_REAL=yes  # optional


Let's run through a typical deployment workflow using emoju. For expediency
it won't run the actual juju equivalents, just show them so you can confirm
the equivalences.

juju sparkles<tab> wordpress
juju chequer<tab> cs:wordpress
juju chequer<tab> cs:mysql --series=xenial
juju handsh<tab> wordpress mysql
juju think<tab>
juju think<tab> --format=face_screaming
juju wren<rtab> wordpress debug=yes
# Things will break with debug=yes
juju think<tab>
juju fire_ex<tab> wordpress/0
juju explo<tab> wordpress/0
#nothing works, let's kill the machine
juju skull_and_cro<tab>
